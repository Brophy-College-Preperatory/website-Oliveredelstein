    <p>Enzo Ferrari began an auto racing career in 1919. He soon joined Alfa Romeo and managed its racing division after retiring from driving in 1931. Following World War II, the Ferrari marque earned renown as its drivers racked up numerous major championships, and the company began manufacturing touring cars. However, its founder faced personal turmoil after the early death of his son, while financial issues forced him to explore mergers with other automakers. Ferrari resigned as president of his company in 1977 and died in 1988 at age 90. </p>
